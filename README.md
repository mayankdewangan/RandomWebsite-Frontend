This is a concept-based website focused on promoting environmental awareness and encouraging the reduction of plastic usage. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with smooth scrolling and subtle visual effects implemented to enhance the overall user experience and engagement.
The website is entirely frontend-based and was developed as a creative practice project.
